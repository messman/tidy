# Quick Tides

A mobile-first web app that uses NOAA data to show a simple view of tide information.

Technologies used:
- `webpack` for module imports and bundling.
- `babel` for ES2015+.
- `SCSS` for sanity.

A big thanks to the U.S. government for the [NOAA data](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8419317) and [NOAA api](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/).
