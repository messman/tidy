# Quick Tides API

`quick-tides` is a mobile-first web app that uses NOAA data to show a simple view of tide information.

This API is used as a proxy between the web app and the external APIs (NOAA, for now) that provide tide information.

A big thanks to the U.S. government for the [NOAA data](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8419317) and [NOAA api](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/).
