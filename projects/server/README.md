# tidy-server

This library contains the functionality for creating test data and retrieving actual data used for the front-end of `tidy`.

## Build

This is built as a Node.js server-side library. Use `npm start` to build. 
There is debugging support through the original TypeScript source. 

## Test

`npm test` builds the test-running code (TypeScript) and then runs it. You likely want to run `npm start && npm test` if you've recently made changes.
