# tidy-client

This application is the front-end JS client for the tidy system.

## Build



## Test

Development builds automatically include and use fake local test data created by `tidy-server`.
This allows for more test opportunity and also prevents spamming of the service APIs.

See the `DEFINE` code for more info on the code. Switching between fake local test data and the API is possible from the settings page.
